// There are two mixin files, because I uesed to love SASS, but now I only work with SCSS.
// However I got really accustomed to using the mixins I made in the .sass file in my workflow.
// The SCSS has two mixins, a gradient and a mediaquery one. It's really hard to convert either,
// therefore I use both files, which doesn't harm performance. So everything is fine, nothing to
// see here folks, move along!
